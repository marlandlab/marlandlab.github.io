We are an interdisciplinary research group working at the interface between electronics and biology. We develop miniature devices that sense and transmit information from living systems. Our work spans from fundamental microsystems research to applications in medicine and synthetic biology.

We are based in the [Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/imns) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk), and are a member of the [Centre for Engineering Biology](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/centre-engineering-biology).
