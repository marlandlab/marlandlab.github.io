We are an interdisciplinary research group working at the interface between electronics and biology. We develop miniature devices that transduce signals directly from living systems, with a particular focus on applications in synthetic biology and human physiology.

[Recent examples](https://marlandlab.github.io/projects/) of our research include implantable sensors that monitor patient health in real-time, electrodes to read outputs from engineered cell-free systems, and nanowires that are small enough to sense the electric field of individual biomolecules. Close engagment with end-users to maximises the value and impact of our research.

Underpinning this activity are [tools and techniques](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/facilities/scottish-microelectronics-centre-smc) from the semiconductor industry. These enable nanofabrication of bioelectronic systems, matching the size scales between biological molecules and engineered devices. This approach also allows highly reproducible and scalable manufacturing, offering a pathway to future translation.

Our team is based in the [Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/imns) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk). We are a member of the [Centre for Engineering Biology](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/centre-engineering-biology), and collaborate across the University and NHS Lothian.
