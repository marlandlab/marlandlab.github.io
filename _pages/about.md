We are an interdisciplinary research group working at the interface between electronics and biology. We develop miniature devices that sense and transmit information from living systems. Our work spans from fundamental microsystems research to applications in medicine and synthetic biology. We are based in the [Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/imns) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk), and are a member of the [Centre for Engineering Biology](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/centre-engineering-biology).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
