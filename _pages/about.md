We are an interdisciplinary research group working at the interface between electronics and biology. We develop and test miniature devices that sense and transmit information from living systems. Our interests span from fundamental microsystems research to applications in medicine and synthetic biology.

The team is based in the [Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/imns) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk). We are a member of the [Centre for Engineering Biology](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/centre-engineering-biology), and collaborate widely across the University.
