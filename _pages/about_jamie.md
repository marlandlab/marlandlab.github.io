My PhD training was in Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge (2007-2011), studying RhoGTPase protein signalling in neurons, followed by postdoctoral work at the University of Edinburgh (2012-2015) on bulk endocytosis in neuronal synapses. A strong interest in interdisciplinary research led me to an MSc in sensor systems at the University of Glasgow, and further postdoctoral research at the University of Edinburgh (2016-2020) on implantable biomedical sensors. In 2021, I became a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and established an independent bioelectronics research group. I also teach electronics design and manufacturing at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
