#### **Dr Jamie Marland (PI)**

Jamie Marland is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. He established an independent  research group in 2021 focusing on bioelectronics, and also teaches electronics design and manufacturing at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. His PhD training was in Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge (2007-2011), studying RhoGTPase protein signalling in neurons, followed by postdoctoral work at the University of Edinburgh (2012-2015) on bulk endocytosis in neuronal synapses. A strong interest in interdisciplinary research led him to further postdoctoral work at Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems the University of Edinburgh (2016-2020) on implantable biomedical sensors. Exploring communication between biological and electronic systems is a fundamental theme of his research. He brings together experience in microsystems engineering, electrochemistry, and semiconductor devices to tackle contemporary challenges in biomedicine and synthetic biology. He has received the WCSIM Beloe Fellowship (2018), MDPI Micromachines "Best Paper" (2023), and was a nominee for the EUSA Teaching Awards "Teacher of the Year" (2024).
