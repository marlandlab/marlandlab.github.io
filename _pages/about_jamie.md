My PhD training was in Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge (2007-2011), studying RhoGTPase protein signalling in neurons, followed by postdoctoral work at the University of Edinburgh (2012-2015) on bulk endocytosis in neuronal synapses. A strong interest in interdisciplinary research led me to an MSc in sensor systems at the University of Glasgow, and further postdoctoral research at the University of Edinburgh (2016-2020) on implantable biomedical sensors. In 2021, I became a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and established an independent bioelectronics research group. I also teach electronics design and manufacturing at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
