#### **Shan Zhang (PhD student)**

Shan Zhang joined the University of Edinburgh in 2018 as a BEng (Hons) 2+2 student in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. After graduation, she joined Prof. Ian Underwoodâ€™s group as a PhD student, and is jointly supervised by Dr Jamie Marland. Her work focuses on developing an implantable miniaturised electrochemical oxygen sensor, which is designed to provide an early warning of anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery. This cross-disciplinary project is driven by her interests in microfabrication, biomedical applications and electrochemistry.
