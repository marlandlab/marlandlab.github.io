Members of the Marland Lab are visiting [ESIEE Paris](https://www.esiee.fr/en) this week to learn more about their research on microsystems and biosensing. Thank you very much to [Prof Gaelle Lissorgues](https://pagespro.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/gaelle-lissorgues) and her team for hosting us, and we looking forward to welcoming them to Edinburgh in November!
