Attended the [IMSE Engineering Biology Symposium](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/events/176081/engineering-biology-symposium/) at Imperial College London, where PhD student [Aarushi Ruhela](https://marlandlab.github.io/profiles/) presented her recent PhD work on using HRP as an electrochemical reporter protein in cell-free systems. Great to meet more of the UK EngBio community and to share ideas about the future direction of the field.
