Oxygen is essential for healthy operation of the human body. However, under conditions of disease or injury, the balance of oxygen delivery and consumption within tissues can be impaired. Such impairment is usually invisible, causing important medical events to be missed and preventing the delivery of optimal therapy. To address this need, we are developing a miniature implantable sensor for tissue oxygenation. The sensor is designed to be used in a variety of medical applications including cancer radiotherapy and post-operative patient monitoring, and it is likely to find future applications in other clinical areas. It operates using electrochemical oxygen detection, with microfabricated components to minimise invasiveness.
